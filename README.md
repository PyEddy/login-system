## This is a Sign Up and Sign In client (can be used for servers too)
It's still in development so dont worry if things don't work
If you don't know what you are doing then dont attempt this

### Requirements and install
Python 3.8

There really isn't an installation process, once you installed Python launch login_system.py.

I don't recommend using this if you don't know what you are doing, you can use this code for other projects too, hopefully you can credit me too :)
