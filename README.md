## This API doesn't fully work
It's still in development so dont worry if things don't work
If you don't know what you are doing then dont attempt this lol

### Requirements and install
Python 3.8

There really isn't an installation process, once you installed Python all you need to do is launch Whale2.py (you can try the experimental home.py too)

Do not launch Whale.py as this will not work

I don't recommend using this if you don't know what you are doing, you can use this code for other projects too but pls credit me lol
